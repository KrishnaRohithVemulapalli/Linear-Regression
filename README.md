# Linear Regression Repository

## Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a technique for predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression aims to find the best-fitting line through the data points. The equation of the line is:

`y = β₀ + β₁x + ε`

where:
- `y` is the dependent variable,
- `x` is the independent variable,
- `β₀` is the y-intercept,
- `β₁` is the slope of the line,
- `ε` is the error term.

## Libraries Used

This repository uses the following Python libraries:

- **[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: For implementing linear regression models and metrics.
- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: For creating visualizations and plotting graphs.
- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**: For statistical data visualization.

## Accuracy Metrics

The performance of linear regression models can be evaluated using several metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as:

  `MAE = (1/n) * Σ|yᵢ - ŷᵢ|`

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, which gives more weight to larger errors. It is calculated as:

  `MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²`

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, which brings the error metric back to the same unit as the target variable. It is calculated as:

  `RMSE = √MSE`

- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It is calculated as:

  `R² = 1 - (Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² / Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²)`

## Applications and Uses

Linear Regression is widely used in various fields for:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting future trends based on historical data.
- **Economic Forecasting**: Estimating economic indicators such as GDP, inflation rates, etc.
- **Risk Management**: Assessing and predicting financial risks.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting patient outcomes based on various health metrics.
- **Marketing**: Analyzing sales and customer data to make informed marketing decisions.
